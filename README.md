It's now a archived repository though I may add some functions, and not to set this in settings
## Describe
There are three activities.  
1. First one is the MainActivity started when launch the programme.  
	It has a button to call me conveniently and a login page which I only check the password cause I really don't need to use a server to manage users' info and I need only one user, my lovely goddess, in all.  
2. When login correctly you can start the second page SecActivity.  
	It has a heart-shape set of imageViews. All of them has a layout relative the centre line bilateral symmetry.   
	With a onClickListener, any one of the imageView can start the third activity by a Intent that has images' and describe strings' information to let the third activity show them correctly.  
3. The third activity is divided to two part to show the imageView in black-backgroud and a textView in white-background vertically.    

All activities set a slide from left transition in style.xml.  
Remove the useless status-bar.  
No more.
